# TDO Bot

This is a bot that I built to celebrate the work of outgoing UC Berkeley School of Information professor [Bob Glushko.](people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~glushko/) I ran a Markov chain on the text of [The Discipline of Organizing](http://disciplineoforganizing.org/) and built a bot to regularly tweet snippets of generated text. Some of what it generates is quite convincing, some of it is gibberish.


The code can easily be modified to tweet out from any text. To run it yourself, replace `tdo.txt` with whatever your textfile, create a [Twitter app,](https://apps.twitter.com/) and with your app information run the following command:

    python twitter_bot.py CONSUMER_KEY CONSUMER_SECRET ACCESS_TOKEN ACCESS_SECRET
